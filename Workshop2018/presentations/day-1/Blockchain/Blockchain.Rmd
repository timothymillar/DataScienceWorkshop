Permissioned blockchain, or private blockchain

- requires pre-verification of the participating parties within the network

- these parties are usually known to each other.

## Hyperledger Fabric

An implementation of blockchain technology that is intended as a foundation for developing blockchain applications

Key technical features:

- A shared ledger and smart contracts implemented as "chaincode"
- Privacy and permissioning through membership services
- Modular architecture and flexible hosting options
